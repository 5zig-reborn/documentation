# Fabric installation

## Official releases
Every official release includes a pre-built Fabric jar in the downloads.  
Just drop that file into the Fabric `mods` folder.

## Unreleased versions
* First, grab the 5zig Fabric Patcher from [here](https://github.com/5zig-reborn/5zig-fabric/releases/latest), and an up-to-date 5zig mod from
[here](https://github.com/5zig-reborn/deployments).

* Put both in the Fabric `mods` folder and start Minecraft.

!!! warning
    If you have OptiFine or OptiFabric in your `mods` folder prior to installing the patcher, please remove them.
    You'll be able to add them once the installation is over.

* If everything went well, you should see a prompt to restart your game.  
The installer will automatically delete itself.  
You should now see a file ending with `-Fabric.jar` in your `mods` folder.
