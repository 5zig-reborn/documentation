# Fabric installation

## Official releases
Every official release includes a pre-built Fabric jar in the downloads.  
Just drop that file into the Fabric `mods` folder.

## Unreleased versions

- First, grab the 5zig Fabric Patcher from [here][5zig-patcher], and an up-to-date 5zig mod from [here][5zig-deployments].
- Put both in the Fabric `mods` folder and start Minecraft with your Fabric Loader.
  !!! warning
      If you have OptiFine or OptiFabric in your `mods` folder prior to installing the patcher, please remove them.  
      You'll be able to add them once the installation is over.

- If everything went well, you should see a prompt to restart your game.  
  The installer will automatically delete itself.  
  You should now see a file ending with `-Fabric.jar` in your `mods` folder.
